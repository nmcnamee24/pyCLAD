# UCF-Crime and COMMAND

`pyclad.video` implements a clean-room COMMAND recreation using precomputed
RGB/flow features. It uses the same `Model`, `ConceptsDataset`,
`ConceptIncrementalScenario`, `BaseMetric`, and output-writer contracts as
other pyCLAD modalities.

## Package layout

Video follows the same data, model, strategy, callback, and metric organization
as `pyclad.vision`:

- `data/command_ucf_crime.py` contains the dataset and archive reader;
  `data/video_bag_concept.py` and `data/sample.py` hold the video data contracts.
- `models/command/config.py` holds architecture, loss, and training settings;
  `architecture.py` holds the neural networks; `command.py` holds the model,
  composite loss, and complete-bag training/replay implementation.
- `strategies/cont_train.py` connects the model to the core scenario.
- `callbacks/video_frame_metric_callback.py` handles frame evaluation, using
  `metrics/frame_score_utils.py` and the individual frame metric modules.
- `prediction_results.py` holds the modality-specific prediction result.

Import `CommandModel` from `pyclad.video.models.command.command` and its
configuration classes from `pyclad.video.models.command.config`.

## Run the example

From a source checkout:

```shell
pip install -e '.[video]'
python examples/models/video/command_example.py
```

The example composes the dataset, model, strategy, callbacks, and scenario
directly, as the vision examples do. Edit their configuration in the script
to change the run. `CommandUcfCrimeDataset()` downloads the paired feature
archive when needed and reuses its extracted cache. To read an existing local
archive without downloading, replace the dataset assignment with:

```python
dataset = CommandUcfCrimeDataset(root="/path/to/UCF-Crime")
```

To require a previously downloaded Hugging Face cache, use:

```python
dataset = CommandUcfCrimeDataset(local_files_only=True)
```

The script sets 20 epochs per task; `CommandTrainerConfig` defaults to 100.
It selects CUDA when available, then MPS, then CPU. Edit `epochs` and `device`
in the script to choose other settings.

Results are written to `output.json` in the working directory, including
video-level and frame-level ROC-AUC/AP matrices, final-step averages, timing,
and run metadata. To save a model checkpoint, add this after `scenario.run()`:

```python
model.save_checkpoint(pathlib.Path("command-results.pt"))
```

A local archive must have this layout:

```text
UCF-Crime/
├── all_rgbs/
├── all_flows/
├── train_normal.txt
├── train_anomaly.txt
├── test_normalv2.txt
└── test_anomalyv2.txt
```

Each stream contains one finite `(32, 1024)` NumPy array per manifest row,
located at `<stream>/<video-relative-path>.npy`. The reader rejects malformed
features, unbalanced training manifests, duplicate test videos, and train/test
overlap. Anomaly intervals use positive, ordered, one-based inclusive frame
coordinates; endpoints past the video length are clipped. Repeated training
paths retain distinct bag identifiers, preserving
the COMMAND release's 1,620 rows rather than deduplicating its 1,610 videos.

## Continual workflow

The recreated Section IV-C stream groups anomaly classes as follows:

| Task | Classes |
| --- | --- |
| T1 | Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault |
| T2 | Burglary, Explosion, Fighting, RoadAccidents |
| T3 | Robbery, Shooting, Shoplifting, Stealing, Vandalism |

Each class receives an equally sized, disjoint shard of the normal training
rows. `read_dataset(max_videos_per_class=1)` limits training for smoke runs;
the complete test split stays fixed after every task.

`VideoBagConcept` keeps each video as one object-array row. Its frame labels
remain outside the feature tensors. `CommandModel.fit()` performs ContTrain++
training, retaining optimizer state and complete-bag replay across tasks;
`ContTrainPlusPlusStrategy` connects it to the core scenario. Prediction
returns bag maxima plus window scores. `VideoFrameMetricCallback` expands
those scores to frames and reuses the core metric-matrix reporting, rejecting
predictions that leave any video's frames uncovered. Checkpoints are saved
explicitly through `model.save_checkpoint(path)`. Load them with
`model.load_checkpoint(path)` using the same configuration; the destination
`device` may differ. New checkpoints restore CPU and CUDA random-generator state
for dropout continuation on the same backend. Loading restores those process-wide
RNG states; identical results across devices are not guaranteed. Older checkpoints
remain loadable but cannot restore Torch RNG state that was never saved.

The configured seed controls network initialization and training-bag order.
As with the vision models, constructing a network seeds the process-wide Torch
generator. Passing a prebuilt network preserves its existing weights.

The weakly supervised COMMAND objective and replay operate on complete temporal
bags. Existing tabular strategies such as A-GEM, EWC, and LwF are unchanged;
they are not adapters for this bag-based model.

The example composes the public classes directly; no video-specific CLI or
experiment runner is required. Use `JsonOutputWriter` to serialize the model,
dataset, strategy, and metric callbacks as in other pyCLAD examples.

## Recreation contract

The source is *COMMANDing anomalies: Continual video anomaly detection via
dual-memory and temporal mamba modeling*,
[DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2026.132943](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2026.132943).
Published equations and tables take precedence; public experimental material
informs settings left unspecified. This is not author code or a verified
numerical reproduction.

The architecture retains 32 snippets through RGB/flow fusion, gated temporal
state-space blocks, one-dimensional CBAM, and primary/secondary memory banks.
Defaults use 2,048 feature dimensions, two `256 x 2048` memories, and a
128-dimensional contrastive projection. The default network has 15,036,943
trainable parameters. The objective combines weak MIL ranking, supervised
contrastive, focal classification, anomaly separation, sparsity, smoothness,
and score regularization. Dual-memory deviation supplies the anomaly scores.

Training defaults are 100 epochs per task, batch size 32, replay batch size
16, Adam at `1e-4`, secondary-memory learning rate `1e-5`, decay by 0.1 every
10 epochs, and a 1,000-video replay buffer. Replay balances label, task, and
anomaly-peak quartile. The task scheduler restarts while optimizer and replay
state persist.

The paper leaves temporal block count, CBAM settings, state/projection widths,
dropout, differentiated memory rates, novelty threshold, and exact replacement
rules incompletely specified. `CommandArchitectureConfig`, `CommandLossConfig`,
and `CommandTrainerConfig` expose these assumptions; model metadata and
checkpoints retain their values. Tests establish implementation behavior,
not agreement with published benchmark numbers.
